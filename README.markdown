# Panthro Framework
=================

Yet another Flash Framework. Just because it's fun to learn from making frameworks.

### How to use
-------

One day I'll post a sample project with a full tutorial, but for now, I recommend you look for:

* `com.jaymoretti.core.taskManager.TaskManager` - General Task Manager (be it loading, animating, destroying, etc...)
* `com.jaymoretti.core.debug.LogBook` - Logger that works with pretty much every socket based Logger. 
* `com.jaymoretti.display.pages.*` - Page system.
* `com.jaymoretti.net
